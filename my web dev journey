MY JOURNEY THROUGH LEARNING WEB DEVELOPMENT.

The first time I got interest in this venture was lack of any skilful knowledge about what exactly happens and how it's done to become what it is to be called a website.
The first thing I did was to watch some tutorials about web development on YOUTUBE but it wasn't enough. so I resorted to downloading some theoritical Apps on Google store. This helped me to learn the basics of web development theoritically.
Recently I have been learning about the css or cascading stylesheet as it's known.And I found out that its a little bit more trickier than the HTML but regardless we move on with it. Am yet tackling the theoritical part of it and then I will look forward to the practical set as soon as possible. 
Whereas, when it comes to the Studio Phtoshop programme, Am developing to learning it as slow as possible in order to catch up with it. Although Am facing some challenges with TIME and unexpected challenges like sickness and alot more.
